GSK (GTK Scene Graph Kit) (1) is the modern rendering system and scene graph API introduced in GTK4.
A [scene graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) is the data structure commonly used to represent vector-based graphics.
The scene graph model has emerged over the past few years and succeeds the direct drawing model.
GSK has largely superseded GDK in its role in rendering, but not completely.
Before GSK, applications needing more advanced graphics or animations turned to separate libraries like Clutter.
