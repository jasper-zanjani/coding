Graphene is a GNOME library that provides a thin layer of types for 2D and 3D mathematics (points, vectors, matrices, rectangles, etc.).
It was first developed by GNOME developer Emmanuele Bassi around 2014 to provide a small, focused library for essential types wihtout needing more complex libraries like GSK.
