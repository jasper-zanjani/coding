GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) is the windowing system.
GDK was initially developed as part of GIMP and was a thin wrapper around Xlib, the core library for the X Window System.
It now supports other display protocols, especially Wayland, and integrates with rendering libraries like Cairo for high-quality 2D graphics.
