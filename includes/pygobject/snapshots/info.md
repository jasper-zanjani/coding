[GtkSnapshot][Gtk.Snapshot] provides a high-level API to widgets used to build a declarative description of a widget's visual appearance.
This is done by constructing a tree of [GskRenderNodes][Gsk.RenderNode], which represent specific drawing operations in a GSK scene graph.


Methods:

-   `append_color`
-   `append_stroke`
-   `pop`
-   `transform`
