The [**chrono**](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) crate provides all the functionality needed for date and time operations.

Various types are available in chrono:

- [**DateTime**](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/struct.DateTime.html) to represent a date and time in a timezone

- [**TimeDelta**](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/struct.TimeDelta.html) to represent the magnitude of a time span. It was previously known as Duration (not to be confused with [core::time::Duration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/time/struct.Duration.html)) but that is now a type alias for TimeDelta.
