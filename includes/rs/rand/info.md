A simple application of the **rand** crate can be seen in the Guessing Game.

```rs hl_lines="7"
--8<-- "includes/rs/the-book/02/src/main.rs"
```

Note that some names in the rand crate have changed recently.

-   [`rng`][rng] previously named `thread_rng`
-   `random_range` previously named `gen_range`
