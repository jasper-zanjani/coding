=== "History"

    -   The need to facilitate internationalization of GNU utilities first arose in 1994.

    -   A poorly managed project called glocale first emerged from the efforts of various GNU developers which was eventually abandoned.

    -   Ulrich Drepper first wrote GNU gettext (then called msgutils) in [1995](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/History.html). This ultimately won over people involved with glocale.

    -   In 1997, GNU libc 2.0 included the `gettext`, `textdomain`, and `bindtextdomain` functions.
