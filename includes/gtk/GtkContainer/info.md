There are two kinds of [container](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/class.Container.html) in GTK, both of which are subclasses of the abstract `GtkContainer` (1) base class:
{: .annotate }

1.  

    --8<-- "includes/gtk/callouts/gtkcontainer.md"

<!-- -->

-   Subclasses of `GtkBin` (1) have a single child
    {: .annotate }

    1.  
        --8<-- "includes/gtk/callouts/gtkbin.md"

-   Others can have more than one child
