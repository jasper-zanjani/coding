**enumeration**:   In C# the term **enumeration** refers to the process of successively returning individual values. 
In Python, the term **iteration** is used to refer to the same thing, and **iterable** refers to an object that can be iterated, or parsed out into sub-elements.

- In Python, any object that exposes the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` **dunder** methods are iterable.
- In C#, the `IEnumerable` interface implements enumeration.

Both languages feature a keyword that allows a subclass to access its direct parent.
Whereas in Python the terms **superclass** and **subclass** are used, in C# the terms **base class** and **derived class** are preferred.
