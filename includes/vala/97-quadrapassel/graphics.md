According to Gemini, the project uses Clutter for rendering the game scene and Cairo is used by Clutter to perform the 2D drawing.

The game area and next-piece preview are subclasses of GtkClutter.Embed.
[Clutter](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/clutter#notice), which was a library that allowed experimentation with hardware-accelerated rendering of UIs and animation, has been [archived](https://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) since 2022.
