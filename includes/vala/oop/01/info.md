Here we see that object properties are defined before the constructor.
Note the strange syntax of instantiating an object (highlighted).

Vala examples produced by AI still produce classes with a [destructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructor_(computer_programming)).
Following C++ convention, it takes the name of the class prepended with [tilde `~`](https://docs.vala.dev/tutorials/programming-language/main/03-00-object-oriented-programming/03-03-destruction.html).
