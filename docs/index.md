## S/360

[IBM System/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360) was the first family of mainframe systems designed to cover a variety of small to large applications.
System/360 was notable for featuring compatibility of software between models.
This allowed customers to purchase a small system knowing they could expand it if their needs grew.

A task force was formed in 1961 to chart IBM's strategy for the following decade as well as to incorporate emerging technologies such as the integrated circuit and the 8-bit byte.
At the time, IBM supported five completely separate computer lines with completely distinct applications and capabilities.
The result of the task force was a concept for a single line of general-purpose machines using a single [instruction set architecture (ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Enterprise_Systems_Architecture).

System/360's chief architect was Gene Amdahl and the project was managed by Fred Brooks.

The successor to S/360 was the System/370 mainframe family announced in 1970 which maintained backwards compatibility.

The System/370 line was replaced with System/390 in 1990 which implemented [ESA/390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Enterprise_Systems_Architecture#ESA/390_architecture), the fifth generation of the S/360 ISA.
