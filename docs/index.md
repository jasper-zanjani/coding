!!! info "Workflow"

    I found a good workflow working through a [Python GTK4 tutorial](https://github.com/Taiko2k/GTK4PythonTutorial) which is meticulously crafted to introduced complexity one step at a time.

    1.  Each new iteration is recorded as a code file in the includes directory.
        This allows code files to be sequentially numbered, maintaining cleanliness, while also allowing the markdown file to add context.

    2.  Create a task document that is also numbered after the source file but which adds context, such as a descriptive title, line highlights, etc.
        Having the same numbering as the included code file makes a clear association.
        
    3.  Create an Anki deck equivalent to each **task** and numbered just like the task document.
        This allows the decks to be organized alphabetically, maintaining order.
        The equivalent numbering maintains a clear assocaition.
        It is then up to you to proceed from iteration to iteration progressively to maintain knowledge.
