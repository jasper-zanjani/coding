The Motorola 6800 was released in 1974 a few months after the venerable Intel 8080.
However, discontent had resulted in many engineers leaving the company shortly after its release.
Four design engineers from Motorola joined MOS Technology in 1975 to design a cheaper version of the 6800, which resulted in the 6501.

Although the MOS 6501 was not instruction-compatible with the Motorola 6800, it was pin-compatible, which was enough for Motorola to launch a lawsuit immediately upon release of the 6501 which would drag on for years.
However the design of the even cheaper 6502 proceeded apace.

The 6502 ended up being used in the Apple II, various Atari computers and consoles, and the Nintendo NES.
MOS would eventually be acquired by Commodore.

The Motorola 68000 had been introduced in 1979 and became one of the first widely available 32-bit processors.
As it reduced in price through the 1980s, it was incorporated into the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh.

### Registers

\# | Register | Size | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**PC** | Program Counter | 16 bit | pointer to the next instruction
**SP** | Stack pointer | 8 bit | holds low 8 bits of the next free location on the stack
**A** | Accumulator | 8 bit | used for all arithmetic operations (except for incrementation and decrementation)
**X** | X register | 8 bit | available for holding counter or offset values for memory access. It also has the special function of copying or changing the value of SP.
**Y** | Y register | 8 bits | available for holding counter or offset values for memory access.

## Opcodes
All opcodes are 1 byte in size, and their operands are 0, 1, or 2 bytes
